# NeuralNetwork
Neural Network code for the MNIST dataset and different interations of it

#### V0
First time running with one hidden layer of size 64
Accuracy around 94% with testing and training accuracy being very similar
Possible Issues (Theoretical):
  - Network understands the style of images from the dataset but not digits I might write myself
Possible Solutions:
  - Modify dataset by adding noise and other distorting effects like stretching and rotation to vary the inputs style much more than the dataset currently does
