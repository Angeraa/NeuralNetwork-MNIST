# NeuralNetwork
Neural Network code for the MNIST dataset and different interations of it.

#### V0
Several runs with one hidden layer of size 64 and training of 3 epochs.

Used sigmoid activation function and mean squared error for error.

Accuracy ~93%.

#### V1
Same setup for layers.

Instead uses softmax and cross-entropy for error.

Accuracy ~96%.
