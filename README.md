# NeuralNetwork
Neural Network code for the MNIST dataset and different interations of it

#### V0
First time running with one hidden layer of size 64
Accuracy around 85% with testing and training accuracy being very similar
- At this level, the accuracy seems to be too high. Something must be done wrong in the output layer setup or choice of activation/error functions
